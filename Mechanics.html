    <a>Soldier has the 2nd slowest walking speed in the game after heavy. But via rocket jumping he becomes the most mobile
    class in the game. It has a huge impact in highlander because it allows soldier to rotate into the enemy backlines very quick and flank
    the enemy team. And also it's very important for sacking. To survive Open with soldier, it's mandetory to atleast be able
    to finish the easy Jumps on Jump Academy. It's soldier's most important tool and why he is playing on flank.</a>

    <a>Soldiers rockets have a lot of knockback because of their explotions. Whenever a enemy gets launched into the air you can try
    to hit them in the air and get a clip for your next soldier fragmove :D. It's the most stylish thing that he has and we soldier mains
    burn for this. To learn this mechanic you can firstly start with getting used to the rocket speed in tr_walkway and once your comfortable with it,
    grab a soldier friend and go on a mge server to train you airshots for hours. The're pretty rare in Highlander but still usefull.</a>

    <a>Wallbugging is mostly used in with the Beggar's Bazooka but still has a use with Stock. By finding a angled wall soldier can clip his hitbox
    into the Wall and stay there. It allows to hide over a position where the enemy team is gonna walktrough to get a cheeky medic pick. However it's risky and
    you can get caught very fast. There's a wallbug spot on basically every map so get creative and just be carefull when you go for them and train them before. </a>

      A little trick that every class can do. Every weapon in tf2 (besides Pyros primaries) have a set knockback on the enemy when hitting them. So by doing the same
      thing you do while rocket jumping, you can abuse this knockback to escape certain situations or push in even more. Some only give you a little Knockback like the mini gun on long range
      or scatter gun, while Rocket and Sticky bombs give you a lot of knockback. While you can transition into a pogo Jump when heavy is shooting at you, you can jump far away with a perfectly
      timed rocket surf. It's most likely used by medic or soldier. It's just a little quality of life, which can make you movement faster.
